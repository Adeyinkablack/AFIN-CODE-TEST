# AFIN-CODE-TEST
This is the second website I am creating for my creative agency, AFIN CREATIVES AND CO.
This is my second attempt on designing a website. 
From the first project I was able to understand the importance of making a website more responsive and user friendly, and as such,
I decided to make use of made use HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP and JAVASCRIPT. This change became obvious in the final output of the project. It became more alive and user reponsive. 
I am still learning how to make it as proffessional as it should be and subsequently, changes would be made on my future projects.
In this project I used open source codes to desing the frontend of this website, I added features and functions that would make the UI/UX cool.
Through this project i have been able to understand the elements that make a website responsive and interactive.
